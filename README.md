# Iyzico Time Series Prediction Project

This repository contains a time series prediction project developed using Python and Jupyter Notebook, focusing on sales forecasting and feature engineering. The project utilizes historical data to predict sales trends, with a specific target of forecasting the first three months of 2021 (from 2021-01-01 to 2021-03-31) based on data until the end of 2020.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to explore and apply various data science techniques to forecast time series data accurately. Through feature engineering, model selection, and thorough evaluation, this project aims to produce reliable sales predictions for Iyzico. This work serves as an example of advanced time series analysis, feature engineering, and data visualization skills.

## Project Structure

- **Data Preparation and Cleaning**: Ensures data quality and prepares the dataset for analysis. Data was clean so this part skipped.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracts meaningful features from the original data to enhance prediction accuracy.
- **Modeling and Evaluation**: one of the tree models, LightGBM, was used. Custom cost function was used to evaluate the performance of the model.
- **Prediction and Analysis**: Generates and interprets predictions for the first quarter of 2021.

## Key Features

- **Feature Engineering**: Applies transformations to create additional features, enhancing model inputs.
- **Sales Forecasting**: Predicts future sales trends for Iyzico with a focus on accuracy and interpretability.

## Usage
